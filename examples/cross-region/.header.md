# Basic Example

Creates a cross-region multi-grouped Resilience Hub Application, with 2 EC2 Auto Scaling Groups in USE1 and USE2 - the module groups both \
Auto Scaling Groups in the same AppComponent.

The module will be s3 state-file backed, as it is currently mandatory by Resilience Hub to onboard new terraform-Application using s3 only.\
**Note:** the `main.tf` file contains 3 replacement strings:

- `$BUCKET`, the bucket where we deploy the state file
- `$path/to/file.tfstate"`, the exact path in `$BUCKET` where the state-file will be deployed in
- `$$BUCKET_REGION`, the region where the `$BUCKET` is deployed in
